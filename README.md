# Namaste React 🚀

Episode 1 - Inception
1. What is Emmet?
Emmet is a plugin or developer tool kit that helps make your work faster and substantially enhances HTML and CSS workflows.
Emmet was created by Sergey Chikuyonok. The original name was "Zen Coding." Emmet is available for many editors including Atom, Eclipse, Emacs, Notepad++, Sublime, Vim, Visual Studio (VS) Code, and WebStorm. However, some implementations do not support all the defined snippets and actions.
2. Difference between a Library and Framework?Definition. Libraries provide developers with predefined functions and classes to make their work easier and boost the development process. Framework, on the other hand, is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms.
3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications
4. Why is React known as React?It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook, and the name “React” was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or “reactive.”
5. What is crossorigin in script tag?The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
6. What is diference between React and ReactDOMReact provides the tools and concepts to define component-based user interfaces, ReactDOM handles the task of rendering those interfaces in a web environment. 
7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?By default, React. js builds your project in development mode, which includes features like detailed error messages and debugging tools. However, when you're ready to deploy your application, it's important to build it in production mode to benefit from optimized performance and reduced bundle size.
